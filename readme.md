Welcome to the Battleship game! 
This is a text-based version of the classic game.
You can play against an intelligent AI opponent, "A. Smith". 
Strategize, attack, and sink all the ships to win the game!
Before starting choose if you want to see the board of the AI agent.
During the game just enter coordinates to attack the opponent board.
Misses are displayed as blue circles, hits as red marks and the ships as a green letter S.

Enjoy!!
